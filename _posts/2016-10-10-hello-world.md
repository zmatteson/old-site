I've wanted to set up a website for a long time.  My first idea, circa 2000, was to build an online Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and wizardry, complete with hidden links that would take you to secret webpages. My next great idea was to run a Digimon fanpage, 
hosted by Angelfire or Geocities.

Now that I've grown up a little bit, I'm setting up my first website to host my projects and writing.  I have a few ideas that 
I want to develop over the rest of the year: a roguelike text-based RPG web app, a Star Wars fan fiction piece exploring what
might happen in episode eight, and some articles about my favorite comfort food (ranging from biscuits to Chinese takeout).

I'm following Jonathan McGlone's [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to setting up a website using Jekyll and 
Github Pages.  This website is a work in progress, so I'm sure it will be changing in appearance and content frequently 
over the next few months.
