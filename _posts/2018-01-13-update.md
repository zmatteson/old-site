title: "Life update!"

It's been a year and a half since I created this website.  Since then, I've gotten a job working in front-end development while finishing my degree at Texas State University, and have (mostly) left my professional cooking life behind.

Life has kept me busy, but I want to renew my focus to update my site more often (or at all), and use it as a place to show off my work.

To that end, I'm going to use this blog to keep a working log of my current project, which I'll be posting about later today.  The logs will serve to help me organize my own thoughts, and also provide a rough walkthrough for anyone that finds my projects interesting.  

I'll also occasionally post my own musings about software, life, Star Wars, etc.  But
my projects will be the main focus.
