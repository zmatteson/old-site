<div class="blurb">
	<p>My parents named me Zebulun because they have a sense of humor, but you can call me Zeb.
	   I spent some time growing up overseas and have moved to a new city every five 
	   years or so. I'm currently living in Austin, TX, while finishing my degree in computer
	   science at San Marcos.  I cook for a living, and like to eat everything.  Sometimes I 
	   post pictures of food on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zebmatteson/">instagram</a>, 
	   but usually it's just things that I think are cool.
